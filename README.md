## Getting Started
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed and follow below steps to build and execute.

- `cd MQTTBox`

- `npm install`

- `Open /node_modules/mqtt/lib/connect/ws.js file and goto line 56 or where ever you find below code.`
    else {
        throw new Error('Could not determine host. Specify host manually.')
    }
 `Remove this else block completely. We need this step to make mqtt.js works with webworkers`.

Thats it !!! Your project is setup. Execute below commands in your current folder (MQTTBox) as per your app requirements.

###### Web App Builds
- `gulp build` - Generates `build` folder with all compiled static web assets in your current directory (MQTTBox). You can deploy `build` in you web/app server.

- `gulp` - Live development mode. Use while development to see live reload of your web app when changes done in code.

By default `master` branch has MQTTBox web app. Please check other MQTTBox branches for other platform apps.
 
NOTE: 
1.Web App supports only Websockets because of browser limitations.
2.We are working to make all apps to look in sync.
3.We are working to make all features avaliable to all platforms.
